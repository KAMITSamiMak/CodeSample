# CodeSample

This sample is the Player class of my one-man work in progress mobile first person game project.

The game itself is inspired by 2005 game Condemned: Criminal Origins.
Like Condemned, the project features first person melee and ranged combat using various weapons, though using slightly simplified controls (player can only turn instead of strafing, no looking up or down during movement and combat).

The game also includes "Camera Mode" which is used to complete objectives and acquire in-game collectibles. While the movement itself uses Unity's standard CrossPlatformInput for virtual joystic and buttons, the camera mode uses the accelometer in addition to the UI elements.
